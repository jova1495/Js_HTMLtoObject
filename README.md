# Js_HTMLtoObject by Jovanni Guerrero 👋
*This is my proposal about how convert aun HTML string to an object*
*The object shows principal ideas of some marks from HMTL*


# Starting 🚀
- *Open index.html file and you will see an empty HTML.*
- *Open navigator's console to see the object result.*
- *If you want to try, in Index.js you could change the value of "var str" to another HTML code and see a different result.*

# Gratitutes and comments 👏
- *This code need more dedication and logic to be adaptable to any HTML source. Each HTML code has different semantic according to author. This app try to get ideas from the actual HTML. If you want to try with different HTML is no problem but is probably you can not get the results that you expect*
- *I hope you enjoy this little app*
